            <h2>Biography</h2> 
            <div>

                <p>My name is Ivana San Pedro. My current major is Computer Science. I never imagined I'd pursue a career in regard to computers or tech as it 
                    was something I didn't have a big interest in. My cousin who graduated from UMD with a bachelor's degree for CS inspired me, she inspired me to 
                    get out of my comfort zone. Though I will agree it's not the easiest, I will continue to persevere through these challenges. 
                </p>

                <p>When I'm not busy working on assignments, you can find me at the gym or out with friends with my film camera. About seven years ago, I took up 
                    photography as a hobby, and my love for it hasn't died down. Since then, I've grown a big interest for film. I love the idea of capturing a moment
                    and the inability to replicate that digitally.
                </p>

            <h2>An Excerpt from The Picture of Dorian Gray</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Yes: there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new Hedonism that was to recreate life and to
                    save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism that is having, in our own day, its curious revival. It
                    was to have its service of the intellect, certainly, yet it was never to accept any theory or system
                    that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience. Its aim, indeed, was to be
                    experience itself, and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might be. Of the
                    asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar profligacy that dulls them, it was to know
                    nothing. But it was to teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself
                    but a moment.</p>

                <p>There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either after one of those dreamless
                    nights that make us almost enamoured of death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy,
                    when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself, and
                    instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its
                    enduring vitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have
                    been troubled with the malady of reverie. Gradually white fingers creep through the curtains, and
                    they appear to tremble. In black fantastic shapes, dumb shadows crawl into the corners of the room
                    and crouch there. Outside, there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men
                    going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills and wandering
                    round the silent house, as though it feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep
                    from her purple cave. Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by degrees the forms and
                    colours of things are restored to them, and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique
                    pattern. The wan mirrors get back their mimic life. The flameless tapers stand where we had left
                    them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been studying, or the wired flower that we
                    had worn at the ball, or the letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often.
                    Nothing seems to us changed. Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we
                    had known. We have to resume it where we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of
                    the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits, or a
                    wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had been
                    refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh shapes
                    and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or
                    no place, or survive, at any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance
                    even of joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain.</p>
